									<h2>Research</h2>

									Spacecraft explore places humans simply cannot! Whether it is the chemical composition of the atmosphere,
									the magnetic field environment, or the craters on the surface, these observatories provide an wealth of data that elucidate
									the environments of Earth's closest companions. Solar System exploration is exciting because we can truly imagine what it
									might be like to live on Mars, for example, because intrepid robotic explorers have sent us
									<a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/explore/mars-now/">images</a> of the red planet.

									I wish to probe the unique environments found in our solar system with help from such spacecraft.
									My research uses data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) to study electron acceleration in the Martian magnetotail.
									The magnetotail is the region of the magnetosphere where the sun's magnetic field drapes about the planet, much like that of a comet.
									Understanding the mechanisms which occur in this region can tell us about Mars' interaction with the sun and allow us to make assumptions
									about this relationship with other unmagnetized bodies (like Venus or exoplanets).
									MAVEN's primary goal is to shine light on Mars' atmospheric evolution/loss to space and it has taught us much about how planetary ion escape down the tail.
									My goal is to uncover the mechanisms and drivers that lead to planetary electron escape.

										<p>
										I'm a PhD student in UC Berkeley's Earth and Planetary Science department.
											As a <a href="https://www.fisk-vanderbilt-bridge.org/">Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge</a> fellow, I obtained an M.S. in Physics
											from Fisk University. My research used the rad <a href="https://www.tng-project.org/">Illustris</a> cosmological simulation
										    to measure the clustering properties of binary black hole mergers, with the goal of determining the potential for biased
											structure measurements from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (<a href="https://www.elisascience.org/">LISA</a>) data stream.
										</p>

										<p>
											My love of planetary science research was sparked during my undergraduate degree at the University of Colorado Boulder.
											As part of the MAVEN science team, I characterized the spatial distribution of thermal electrons in the Martian magnetotail at
											the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (<a href="https://lasp.colorado.edu/home/">LASP</a>).

											<p>
												I am a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Guyana/@4.9396692,-61.203137,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8dafefaf60d8c2b3:0x48e38867b6e54440!8m2!3d4.860416!4d-58.93018">Guyanese</a>-American
												whose path towards planetary science research has been unconventional. In my junior year of college,
												I upended my career plans (international affairs/economics) due to the lack of paid internships to try planetary science research.
												Working with the MAVEN team, I learned an immense amount about programming (we <b>love</b> IDL) and the research process.
												I then obtained a Master's degree in physics after defending my thesis in 2020.
												Now, I am a PhD student in the Earth & Planetary Science department at UC Berkeley.

											My other passions involve exploring the incredible wilderness here on Earth, my favorite planet :)
											To be a first-generation student who comes from a low-income background, I am grateful for the privilege
											to pursue these passions.

											As an avid climber, I maneuver in unusual spaces often. I wrote an essay with suggestions of how climbers can actively pursue anti-racism. Despite mention of uncomfortable instances, this essay is not an expos&eacute; of racism in climbing. It is an attempt to shed light on the burden many climbers of color feel and provide suggestions to alleviate this burden.
