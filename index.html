									Spacecraft explore places humans simply cannot! Whether it is the chemical composition of the atmosphere,	the magnetic field environment, or the craters on the surface, these observatories provide a wealth of data that elucidate the environments of Earth's closest companions.
									We can truly imagine what it might be like to live on other planets because intrepid robotic explorers give us this information.

									I wish to probe the unique environments found in our solar system with help from such spacecraft.
									My research uses data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) to study electron acceleration in the Martian magnetotail.
									The magnetotail is the region of the magnetosphere where the sun's magnetic field drapes about the planet, much like that of a comet.
									My interest in Mars research began as an undergraduate research assistant at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at CU Boulder.
									Understanding the mechanisms which occur in this region can tell us about Mars' interaction with the sun and allow us to make assumptions
									about this relationship with other unmagnetized bodies (like Venus or exoplanets).

															During this NASA-funded workshop, we will create educational materials with other early career scientists and engineers to broaden participation of historically marginalized communities.

												<li>Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park AstroFest (2022) </li>
														<ul>
															As one of the park's visiting astronomers, I gave a series of "porch talks" about life on Mars and was a professional voice during telescope observing. Throughout the 3 day festival, we engaged hundreds of visitors.

												<li>Fiske Planetarium (2013-2017) </li>
														<ul>
															Between operating the 8K dome, giving talks, engaging K-12 students in the portable dome, selling tickets, managing students, creating laser light shows, and administrative tasks, I wore multiple hats during my time at Fiske. We made the distant world of astronomy more accessible to families, college students, and all visitors.

												My path towards planetary science research began when I changed my career plans of working in international affairs due to the lack of paid positions in the sector.
												The availability of funding in planetary science allowed me to pursue a meaningful career without making financial sacrifices.
												To be a first-generation student whose grandmother is illiterate, I am grateful to pursue the highest level of educational attainment and a career in research.

											As an avid climber, I maneuver unusual spaces often. I wrote an <a href="https://www.rockandice.com/climbing-news/redpointing-anti-racism/">essay</a> for <i>Rock and Ice Magazine</i> with suggestions of how climbers can actively pursue anti-racism. It's not an expos&eacute; of racism in climbing, but an attempt to shed light on the burden many climbers of color feel and provide suggestions to alleviate this burden. Since the publishers are charging for access, here is a <a href="images\redpointing_antiracism.pdf">PDF copy</a>.
